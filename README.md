# Todo-Vanilla-Javascript

This is a basic Todo app using just html,css,javascript no frameworks 
i made it responsive using media queries so it should be fine in mobile view
The todos you enter stored in your local storage so that it stays there when you refresh or when you come back later

will improve the styling little more
